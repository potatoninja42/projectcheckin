Final Project


This program was created to extract delivery information from a pdf file, the information needed is the addresses and dates when packages were delivered and the person who delivered them, the addresses are grouped  by date. These addresses are also added up to calculate the amount packages delivered in a day.

This program outputs: 
The name of the person responsible
The courier id
A list of dates with associated addresses
A count of total addresses for each day

Modules and Libraries in this script
tkinter library
filedialog from tkinter
Os module
pdfplumber
re module


To run this program pdfplumber has to be installed.

The script can be executed as normal, a GUI window will open, click the button to run the script. it will prompt you to select a pdf file to process, then it will ask for a name for the new txt file being created. 

As a future project, I would like to make this program to make it look like an app and have its own logo, I would also want it to export to an excel file instead of a txt file.
